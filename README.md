# 🎯 Special Forces Group 3 — Offline Hacking Lab

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
> All testing is done **offline** against **bots** with **no connection to online servers**.  
> No modified files are shared or distributed.

## 📌 Overview
This is a private learning project focused on reverse engineering and gameplay modification of  
**Special Forces Group 3** in **offline mode**.  
The main goals are to create and test:
- 🛠 **Aimbot** — Automatic aim assist for research into targeting systems.
- 🗺 **Radar (ESP)** — Displays enemy positions on a custom minimap overlay.
- 🔫 **Weapon Tweaks** — No recoil, higher fire rate, custom damage values.

All experiments are performed locally to avoid breaking laws or the game’s terms of service.

## ⚖️ Why This Is Legal in My Case
✔ **Offline Mode Only**  
All modifications are tested in bot matches without affecting real players.  

✔ **Private Use**  
The modded APK is kept on my own device/emulator — no distribution.  

✔ **Educational Purpose**  
This is a sandbox project for learning reverse engineering, Unreal Engine modding,  
and basic anti-cheat concepts.  

✔ **Respect for IP**  
All rights to the original game remain with ForgeGames.  
No claim is made to the game’s assets or code.
