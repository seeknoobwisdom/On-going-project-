# 🎯 Battle Royale Fire Force Free — Offline Modding Lab

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
> All modifications are tested **offline**, against **bots**, with **no connection to online servers**.  
> No modified files are shared or distributed.

---

## 📌 Overview
This is a personal learning project focused on reverse engineering and gameplay modification.  
The goal is to create and test:
- 🛠 **Aimbot** — Automatic aim assist for learning targeting logic.
- 🗺 **Radar (ESP)** — Displays enemy positions on a custom minimap overlay.

All experiments are performed **locally** to avoid breaking laws or game terms of service.

## ⚖️ Why This Is Legal in My Case
✔ **Offline Mode Only**  
No real players are affected — all tests are against AI bots.  

✔ **Private Use**  
The modified APK stays on my local device/emulator.  

✔ **Educational Focus**  
This project helps me understand how cheats work so I can apply the knowledge in **ethical security testing** and **anti-cheat development**.  

✔ **No IP Theft**  
I do not claim ownership of the original game. All rights remain with the developer.
